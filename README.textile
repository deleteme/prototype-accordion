h2. Disabling Accordions

The accordion and it's sections have the ability to be disabled using the disable() method. This method is available on the main accordion object and it's section objects.

* If an *entire accordion* is disabled, a CSS class of 'disabled' is applied to the root element.
* If an *accordion section* is disabled, a CSS class of 'disabled' is applied to the corresponding section element.

h2. Custom Events

An instance of the main Accordion class fires custom events that you can hook into. The *id* is the id of the root accordion element that is passed to the Accordion class as the first argument.
